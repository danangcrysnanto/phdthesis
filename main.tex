The assembly of the draft \emph{Bos taurus }reference genome was a milestone for genetics- and genomics-oriented research in cattle. The reference genome was built from a single animal from the Hereford breed. However, the linear reference sequence does not represent genetic diversity of global cattle breeds. The lack of diversity causes problems, particularly when DNA sequences from genetically distant animals are aligned and compared to the reference sequence. This issue is widely known as reference bias. Pangenomes are an intriguing novel reference structure to consider the full-spectrum of genetic diversity within a species. A richer, graph-based pangenome reference can integrate multiple  genome assemblies and their sites of variations in a coherent and non-redundant data structure. This thesis investigated for the first time the utility of graph-based references for genomic analysis in a livestock population.

Chapter 2 assessed the feasibility of graph-based genomic analysis in cattle. Specifically, a graph-based sequence variant genotyping approach was implemented using the\emph{ Graphtyper} software and compared to two widely-used methods (\emph{SAMtools } and \emph{GATK}) that rely on a strictly linear representation of the reference using whole-genome sequencing data of 49 Original Braunvieh cattle. Comparison between sequence variant and array-derived genotypes indicated that the graph-based approach outperformed both \emph{SAMtools} and \emph{GATK} with regard to genotype concordance, non-reference sensitivity, non-reference discrepancy, and Mendelian inconsistencies. These findings demonstrated that graph-based genotyping using \emph{Graphtyper} is accurate, sensitive, and computationally feasible in the cattle genome. 

Chapter 3 reports on the construction of breed-specific and multi-breed genome graphs for four European cattle breeds (Original Braunvieh, Brown Swiss, Fleckvieh, and Holstein).  The \emph{vg toolkit} was used to augment the linear reference sequence with variants that were prioritized based on allele frequency in different breeds. Based on both real and simulated short-read sequencing data, this study showed that variant prioritization is crucial to build informative genome graphs. Intriguingly, adding many low frequency and rare variants to the genome graphs compromised mapping accuracy. Moreover, this chapter demonstrates that pangenome graphs and breed-specific graphs enable almost identical mapping improvements over a linear reference genome. Finally, the first whole-genome graph was constructed for the Brown Swiss cattle breed using 14 million variants. The application of this whole-genome graph facilitated accurate short-read mapping and unbiased sequence variant discovery.

Chapter 4 reports on integrating of six reference-quality bovine genome assemblies into a unified multi-assembly graph using the \emph{minigraph} software. The pangenome contains 70 megabases that are not present in the current ARS-UCD1.2 \emph{Bos taurus} reference genome.  Using complementary bioinformatics approaches, this chapter provides compelling evidence that these non-reference sequences contain functionally active and biologically-relevant elements. Specifically, the analysis of RNA sequencing data revealed putatively novel genes, including some that are differentially expressed between individual animals. Moreover, variant discovery in the non-reference sequences revealed thousands of yet undetected polymorphic sites capturing genetic differentiation across cattle breeds. Chapter 4 demonstrated that multi-assembly graphs make so far neglected genetic variations amenable to genetic investigations. 

Overall, thesis presents a novel analysis paradigm in livestock genomics by leveraging variation-aware reference structures. The array of analyses presented in this thesis provides a first step towards the transition from linear to graph-based reference structures to mitigate inherent biases of the linear reference genome. Importantly, this thesis establishes a computational framework to integrate multiple genome assemblies and their sites of variations into a more diverse reference structure broadly applicable across species.

The thesis is structured as follow:

Chapter 1 provides a literature review to introduce the concept of a reference genome, pangenome, graph-based pangenome, and applications of the pangenome. \\


Chapter 2 reports a first feasibility assessment of a genome graph-based variant discovery method in a livestock population. This chapter is published in \emph{Genetics Selection Evolution}. \\ 


Chapter 3 reports on the construction of the first  whole-genome graphs in cattle and their application to read mapping and variant discovery. This chapter is published in \emph{Genome Biology}. \\


Chapter 4 reports on the first construction of a bovine multi-assembly graph from six reference-quality assemblies and its application to investigate sequences not included in the current Bos taurus reference genome. This chapter has been accepted for publication in \emph{Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS)}. \\


Chapter 5 provides a general discussion, and outlook for future research

This chapter assessed the feasibility of the genome graphs in cattle genome for variant genotyping; the first graph-based genotyping approach applied in any agricultural animal. The region-specific graphs were constructed using variations discovered from the sequencing cohort implemented using \emph{Graphtyper}. The genotyping pipeline was based on refined sequencing read alignment towards the local graphs. The genotyping analysis showed that graph-based approach using \textit{Graphtyper} is highly accurate, outperforming state-of-the-art methods based on linear reference e.g., \textit{SAMtools} and \emph{GATK}. \\

\bigskip

% I assessed \emph{Graphtyper} software for variant genotyping in cattle.
% \emph{Graphtyper} performed two round of genotyping. The first is to discover variants from linear
% genome. And the second round used the variants discovered in the first round to construct a local genome graph and used it to refine the genotypes. I discovered that \textit{graph genotyping} using \textit{Graphtyper} is highly accurate in cattle and outperform current approaches e.g., \textit{SAMtools, \emph{GATK}} that are based on linear reference. My work is the first to apply \textit{graph genome} for sequence variant genotyping in the livestock genome.  I implemented the graph genotyping pipeline and it is now publicly available at \\

\subsection*{}
\normalsize
This chapter first evaluated the variant prioritization to the breed-specific and multi-breed genome graphs based on the sequence variants of four Europen cattle breeds (Original Braunvieh, Brown Swiss, Fleckviech, Holstein). Further, the first cattle whole-genome graph was constructed using the \emph{vg toolkit}; the first assessment of a gigabase genome-graph in any livestock species. Applications of this whole-genome graph facilitated accurate read mapping and unbiased sequence variant genotyping. \\

% In this chapter, I constructed the first cattle whole genome graph and performed the first assessment of the gigabase genome graph on the species other than human. I showed using both real and simulated datasets that the graph facilitate accurate read mapping and unbiased sequence variant genotyping. I developed the graph pipeline further from previous implementation based on \emph{vg toolkit} allowing graph analysis performed in a full genome scale. Additionally, I included catalogues of previously discovered variants to the graph, which showed that \emph{breed-specific} graph perform similarly as the \emph{multi-breed pangenome graph}. \\

% \emph{Contribution}: I and Hubert Pausch conceived the study, I wrote the full genome graph pipelines and performed all analyses. I wrote the initial draft of the manuscript with input from Hubert Pausch.

\subsection*{}
\normalsize
This chapter investigated the utility of multi-assembly graphs that integrated the collection of genome assemblies into a unified representation. The first bovine multi-assembly graph was constructed that unified six cattle assemblies, including its close relatives of Brahman and Yak using the \emph{minigraph} software. The application of the multi-assembly graph identified the 70 Mb sequences not included in the existing \emph{Bos taurus} reference genome. Further analysis showed that these non-reference sequences contain abundant functionally relevant sequences. \\
