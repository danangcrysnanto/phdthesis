We report a new haplotype-aware scaffolding and polishing pipeline using contigs generated by the trio binning method to produce haplotype-resolved, chromosome-level genome assemblies of Angus (taurine) and Brahman (indicine) cattle breeds. These assemblies were used to identify structural and copy number variants that differentiate the subspecies and we found variant detection was sensitive to the specific reference genome chosen. Six gene families with immune related functions are expanded in the indicine lineage. Assembly of the genomes of both subspecies from a single individual enabled transcripts to be phased to detect allele-specific expression, and to study genome-wide selective sweeps. An indicus-specific extra copy of fatty acid desaturase is under positive selection and may contribute to indicine adaptation to heat and drought.},

Low-coverage sequencing assembles high-coverage sequence information for every individual by accumulating data from the genome segments that they share with many other individuals into consensus haplotypes. Deriving the consensus haplotypes accurately is critical for achieving a high phasing and imputation accuracy. In order to enable accurate phasing and imputation of sequence information for the whole population, we allocate the available sequencing resources among individuals with existing phased genomic data by targeting the sequencing coverage of their haplotypes.},

@article{Hokin2020,
abstract = {Complex diseases, with many associated genetic and environmental factors, are a challenging target for genomic risk assessment. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) associate disease status with, and compute risk from, individual common variants, which can be problematic for diseases with many interacting or rare variants. In addition, GWAS typically employ a reference genome which is not built from the subjects of the study, whose genetic background may differ from the reference and whose genetic characterization may be limited. We present a complementary method based on disease association with collections of genotypes, called frequented regions, on a pangenomic graph built from subjects' genomes. We introduce the pangenomic genotype graph, which is better suited than sequence graphs to human disease studies. Our method draws out collections of features, across multiple genomic segments, which are associated with disease status. We show that the frequented regions method consistently improves machine-learning classification of disease status over GWAS classification, allowing incorporation of rare or interacting variants. Notably, genomic segments that have few or no variants of genome-wide significance (p < 5 × 10−8) provide much-improved classification with frequented regions, encouraging their application across the entire genome. Frequented regions may also be utilized for purposes such as choice of treatment in addition to prediction of disease risk.},

@inproceedings{Smith2020,
abstract = {The “gold standard” for conducting genomic research in any organism has been to first create a usable draft reference genome. However, it is increasingly recognized that a single reference genome, while very useful, is inadequate to fully describe the extent of genetic variation, even in relatively low-diversity species such as humans. This observation is the basis of the recently-announced Human Pangenome Reference Sequence Project (HPRSP), which aims to generate high-quality assemblies of the diversity of human genomes. Fortunately, advances in sequencing technologies have reduced the cost of creating assemblies to the point where even livestock species could reasonably achieve a similar goal if global resources can be marshaled to this end. The other big challenge to creating a useful Pangenome resource from these assemblies, is a method for representing genomes in such a way as to serve as a comprehensive reference map of genetic variation that includes all DNA segments existing in all members of the species. This latter challenge is a major initiative within HPRSP, and the tools developed there should be applicable to other species. We propose an initiative within the global cattle genomic research community, to generate reference-quality genomes for as many cattle breeds as possible. We suggest that the best strategy will make use of F1 crosses of breeds using the trio binning approach, and will outline a proposed framework to achieve a cattle pangenome in a time frame to coincide with development of visualization and analysis tools in the human genome community.},

abstract = {The DNA sequencing technologies in use today produce either highly accurate short reads or less-accurate long reads. We report the optimization of circular consensus sequencing (CCS) to improve the accuracy of single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing (PacBio) and generate highly accurate (99.8%) long high-fidelity (HiFi) reads with an average length of 13.5 kilobases (kb). We applied our approach to sequence the well-characterized human HG002/NA24385 genome and obtained precision and recall rates of at least 99.91% for single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), 95.98% for insertions and deletions <50 bp (indels) and 95.99% for structural variants. Our CCS method matches or exceeds the ability of short-read sequencing to detect small variants and structural variants. We estimate that 2,434 discordances are correctable mistakes in the ‘genome in a bottle' (GIAB) benchmark set. Nearly all (99.64%) variants can be phased into haplotypes, further improving variant detection. De novo genome assembly using CCS reads alone produced a contiguous and accurate genome with a contig N50 of >15 megabases (Mb) and concordance of 99.997%, substantially outperforming assembly with less-accurate long reads.},
